Perform K-means with K=2
Calculate the likelihood at the centres of
    the two clusters
find the midpoint of the two centres
calculate the likelihood at the midpoint

if (the midpoint has greater likelihood
   than either centre):
    all points are within the same cluster
else: 
    recurively apply L-means to each cluster
